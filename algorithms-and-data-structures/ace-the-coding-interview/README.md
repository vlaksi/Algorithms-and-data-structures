<h1 align = "center"> Ace the coding interview </h1>

Make sure to learn the following data structures before try to ace the coding interview:
  - ***Dynamic Array*** 
  - ***Linked List*** 
  - ***Stack & Queue*** 
  - ***Hash Tables*** 
  - ***Binary Search Tree*** 
  - ***Binary Heaps & Priority*** 
  - ***Graphs*** 
  - ***Trie***
  
<br><br>
And review the following algorithms:
  - ***Binary search***
  - ***DFS (Depth-First Search)*** 
  - ***BFS (Breadth-First Search)***
  - ***Binary Tree Traversals (In-order, pre-order and post-order traversals)*** 
  - ***Traveling Salesman***

## Advice

Try to use ***Cracking the Coding Interview*** and ***LeetCode***
The single most important aspect of preparing for technical interviews is to solve many coding challenges. Although some tech companies have stopped asking algorithm questions and instead test domain-specific knowledge, most tech giants (and even the small ones) still require candidates to solve coding challenges. Many engineers get frustrated about this. Getting frustrated is completely pointless and a waste of energy that can be spent on more productive ways.

### The strategy:
  1. Go to a quiet location.
  2. Pick a question.
  3. Set a timer for ***25 minutes***
  4. Allocate the first ***5 minutes*** to ***understand the problem*** and ask/answer ***clarifying questions*** to yourself.
  5. Spend the next ***20 minutes*** ***solving the problem*** on ***paper & pen/pencil*** (until timer rings).
  6. Spend the next ***10 minutes studying the solution***.
  7. ***Stop***. Even if you’re in the middle of something important like trying to understand the solution. 
  8. Do not spend more than ***30–35 minutes per question***.
  9. Record activity on your progress chart.
  10. Revisit the question next week.
