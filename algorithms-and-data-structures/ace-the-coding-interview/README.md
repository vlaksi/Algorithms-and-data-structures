## Must know
***Core Data Structures, Algorithms, and Concepts***<br><br> 
Most interviewers won't ask about specific algorithms for binary tree balancing or other complex algorithms. Frankly, being several years out of school, they probably don't remember these algorithms either. 
You're usually only expected to **know the basics**. Here's a list of the ***absolute, must-have knowledge***

And also review the following algorithms:
  - ***Binary Tree Traversals (In-order, pre-order and post-order traversals)*** 
  - ***Traveling Salesman***

## Advice

Try to use ***Cracking the Coding Interview*** and ***LeetCode***
The single most important aspect of preparing for technical interviews is to solve many coding challenges. Although some tech companies have stopped asking algorithm questions and instead test domain-specific knowledge, most tech giants (and even the small ones) still require candidates to solve coding challenges. Many engineers get frustrated about this. Getting frustrated is completely pointless and a waste of energy that can be spent on more productive ways.

### The strategy:
  1. Go to a quiet location.
  2. Pick a question.
  3. Set a timer for ***25 minutes***
  4. Allocate the first ***5 minutes*** to ***understand the problem*** and ask/answer ***clarifying questions*** to yourself.
  5. Spend the next ***20 minutes*** ***solving the problem*** on ***paper & pen/pencil*** (until timer rings).
  6. Spend the next ***10 minutes studying the solution***.
  7. ***Stop***. Even if you’re in the middle of something important like trying to understand the solution. 
  8. Do not spend more than ***30–35 minutes per question***.
  9. Record activity on your progress chart.
  10. Revisit the question next week.
