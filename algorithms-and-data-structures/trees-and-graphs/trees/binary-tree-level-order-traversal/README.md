<h1 align = "center"> Binary Tree Level Order Traversal </h1>

Given a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, level by level).<br><br>
For example:<br>
Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]<br><br>

  ```sh
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```
return its level order traversal as:
  ```sh
[
  [3],
  [9,20],
  [15,7]
]
```
