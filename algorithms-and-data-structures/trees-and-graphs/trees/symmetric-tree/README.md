<h1 align = "center"> Symmetric Tree </h1>
Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (ie, symmetric around its center).
<br><br>
For example, this binary tree [1,2,2,3,4,4,3] is symmetric:
  ```sh
    1
   / \
  2   2
 / \ / \
3  4 4  3
```
But the following [1,2,2,null,3,null,3] is not:
```sh
    1
   / \
  2   2
   \   \
   3    3
```
