<h1 align = "center"> Linked lists </h1>

A linked list is a data structure that represents a ***sequence of nodes***. In a singly linked list. each node points to the next node in the linked list. A doubly linked list gives each node pointers to both the next node and the previous node. 
<br><br>

Unlike an array, a linked list does not provide constant time access to a particular "index" within the list. This means that if you'd like to find the Kth element in the list, you will need to iterate through K elements. 
The benefit of a linked list is that you can ***add and remove*** items from the beginning of the list in ***constant time***. For specific applications, this can be useful.

## Single:

### pros:
  - less memory required
  - easier implementation
  - faster insertions and deletions
### cons:
  - can only traverse in one direction

## Double:

### pros:
  - can traverse in either direction
### cons:
  - more memory required
  - more complicated implementation
  - slower insertions and deletions
