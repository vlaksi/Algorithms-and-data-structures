<h1 align = "center"> Maximum Depth of Binary Tree </h1>
Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.<br><br>

The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.<br><br>

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

Example:<br>

Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],
  ```sh
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```
return its depth = 3.
