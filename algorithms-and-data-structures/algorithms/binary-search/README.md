<h1 align = "center"> Binary search </h1>

In binary search, we look for an element x in a ***sorted array*** by first comparing x to the ***midpoint*** of the array. If x is ***less*** than the midpoint, then we search the ***left half*** of the array. If x is ***greater*** than the midpoint, then we search the ***right half*** of the array. We then ***repeat this*** process, treating the left and right halves as subarrays.<br><br> Again, we compare x to the midpoint of this subarray and then search either its left or right side. We repeat this process until we either find x or the subarray has size O.
