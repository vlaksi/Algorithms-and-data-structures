## Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms

Data Structures are **structures programmed to store ordered data**, so that various operations can be performed on it easily. It represents the knowledge of data to be organized in memory. It should be designed and implemented in such a way that it reduces the complexity and increases the efficiency.

## What is an Algorithm

An algorithm is a finite set of instructions or logic, written in order, to accomplish a certain predefined task. Algorithm is not the complete code or program, it is just the ***core logic(solution) of a problem***, which can be expressed either as an informal high level description as pseudocode or using a flowchart.


Every Algorithm must satisfy the following properties:
  - ***Input***- There should be 0 or more inputs supplied externally to the algorithm.
  - ***Output***- There should be atleast 1 output obtained.
  - ***Definiteness***- Every step of the algorithm should be clear and well defined.
  - ***Finiteness***- The algorithm should have finite number of steps.
  - ***Correctness***- Every step of the algorithm must generate a correct output.

An algorithm is said to be ***efficient and fast, if it takes less time to execute and consumes less memory space***. The performance of an algorithm is measured on the basis of following properties :
  - ***Time Complexity***
  - ***Space Complexity***
